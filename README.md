# Multiple-Disease   

This Streamlit project is a Multiple Disease Prediction System using Machine Learning to predict the likelihood of Diabetes, Heart Disease, and Parkinson's Disease. Users can input health data to receive predictions, such as "The person is not having heart disease." Each disease section integrates a machine learning model trained on relevant health datasets for accurate risk assessment. It provides a user-friendly interface for early self-assessment and educational purposes. The project showcases the practical application of ML in healthcare prediction.
